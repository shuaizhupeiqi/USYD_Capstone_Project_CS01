# HomePage



## Introduction

> The `HomePage` component is a React functional component that acts as the central hub for a web application focused on providing heat stress scale (HSS) data. It leverages a combination of hooks for state management, helper functions for data fetching and processing, and custom components to present a responsive and interactive user interface. The component is designed to be both informative and intuitive, allowing users to view HSS data based on their location and preferences.

## Key Functionalities

### State Management

- `useState` for local state management of loading status, address information, forecast data, risk levels, and more.
- `useRecoilState` for global state management of user location and page refresh triggers.

### Translation and Localization

- `useLanguage` hook to apply translations, ensuring the UI is accessible to users in different languages.

### Geolocation and Risk Data Processing

- `reverseGeocode` and `getTimezone` functions to determine user's precise location and corresponding timezone.
- `getHSSData` function to fetch and process heat stress data based on user's geolocation and selected time.

### User Interaction

- `AddressDropDown` component to enable users to select or search for locations.
- `HssRiskDisplay` component to visualize the heat stress risk data.

### Lifecycle Methods

- `useEffect` for initializing the component state, fetching data, and setting up event listeners.

### Event Handlers

- `handleLocateMeCallBack` for acquiring the user's current geolocation.
- `handleAddressCallBack` for handling location selection from the dropdown.

### Rendering Logic

- Conditional rendering to manage the display of loading indicators and the presentation of data based on public or private display modes.
- `useMemo` to optimize the rendering performance of the address dropdown.

## Code Examples

### Setting Up Forecast Data

```
const setDay = useCallback(() => {
  let forecastWeekday = [1, 2, 3].map((item) => {
    const [weekNum, dayDate] = getWillDay(item);
    let weekday = week[weekNum];
    return { label: weekday, date: dayDate };
  });

  let currentHour = dayjs().hour();
  setHour(currentHour === 23 ? 0 : currentHour);
  setForcasts(forecastWeekday);
}, [getWillDay]);
```

### Handling Location Selection

```
const handleAddressCallBack = useCallback(async (values) => {
  const [postcode, suburb, lat, lon, state] = values || [];
  const jsonVal = {
    postcode,
    suburb,
    latitude: lat,
    longitude: lon,
    state,
  };

  // ... (user verification and data update logic)

  setDataWhenHandleAddressCallBack(values);
}, [setDataWhenHandleAddressCallBack]);
```

## Conclusion

The `HomePage` component is a multifaceted React component that combines state-of-the-art hooks, data fetching, and user interaction to provide a dynamic and responsive experience. It demonstrates robust state management, asynchronous operations, and conditional rendering strategies. This documentation aims to equip developers with the necessary insights to understand and engage with the `HomePage` component effectively within the application's ecosystem.
