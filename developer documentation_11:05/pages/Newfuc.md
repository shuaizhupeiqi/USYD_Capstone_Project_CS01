## Introduction

> The `WeatherData` component is a React component that integrates with weather and Health Safety Standard (HSS) data. It provides a user interface for displaying weather forecasts, HSS values, and allows for manual HSS calculations. The component includes a dynamic map for geographic data input and uses the Ant Design library for UI elements.

## Component Structure

The `WeatherData` component consists of the following elements:

- **State Management**: It utilizes the `useState` hook for local state management, including weather data, loading status, and user interactions.
- **Dynamic Map**: A map component (`MapComponent`) is imported dynamically to enable geographic data input without server-side rendering.
- **Data Fetching**: The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch HSS data based on the selected geographic coordinates.
- **User Interface**: The component uses Ant Design's `Card`, `Tabs`, `Collapse`, `List`, and `Typography` for a structured and styled interface.

## Key Functionalities

### Interactive Map

The map allows users to click and select geographic coordinates, which then triggers the `handleMapClick` function to update the state and fetch new data.

### Data Display

The fetched data is displayed in a tabbed interface, with the first tab showing today's HSS forecast in a collapsible panel, and the second tab showing detailed local information in a formatted JSON view.

### Manual HSS Value Calculation

A separate tab provides a simple form where users can enter weather parameters to calculate the HSS value. The form includes `Input` fields for humidity, wind, and cloudiness, and a `Button` to submit the data.

### Loading State

While data is being fetched, a `Spin` component from Ant Design is displayed, indicating that the loading process is ongoing.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of how to use the `WeatherData` component within a React application:

```
import React from 'react';
import WeatherData from './WeatherData';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <WeatherData isPublicDisplay={true} publicDisplayGeoData={{ latitude: -33.8, longitude: 151.01 }} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, `WeatherData` is used in the main `App` component, with `isPublicDisplay` and `publicDisplayGeoData` props provided to configure its initial state.

## Conclusion

The `WeatherData` component is a comprehensive solution for applications that require interaction with weather and HSS data. It provides a dynamic and interactive map for data input, a clean and structured interface for data display, and functionality for manual HSS calculations. This component is a valuable addition to any React application dealing with weather-related data visualization and analysis.
