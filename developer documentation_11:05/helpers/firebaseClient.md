# firebaseClient



## Introduction

> The `firebaseClient` module establishes a connection with Firebase's suite of services and provides additional functionality for analyzing user input changes via Google Analytics. This module is essential for developers looking to integrate Firebase into their web applications and gain insights into user interactions.

## Module Setup

Ensure Firebase is installed and configured in your project. Initialize the Firebase services with your project's specific configuration settings.

## Firebase Services Initialization

The module initializes the following Firebase services:

- **Storage**: For storing and retrieving user-generated content like images, audio, and video.
- **Firestore**: A NoSQL database for storing and syncing data in real-time.
- **Realtime Database**: A cloud-hosted database for real-time data manipulation.
- **Analytics**: For tracking user interactions and gaining insights into app usage.

## Analytics Tracking

### trackInputChangeViaFirebase

This function is designed to monitor and log changes made by users in form inputs, utilizing Firebase Analytics for data collection and analysis. This can help developers understand user engagement and interaction with form fields.

**Parameters:**

- `formValues` (Object): An object containing form field names and their corresponding values.

**Usage Example:**

```
trackInputChangeViaFirebase({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'securePassword123'
});
```

This function will iterate over the `formValues` object and use Firebase Analytics to log an event for every input change, capturing the field name and the new value.

**Code:**

```
export const trackInputChangeViaFirebase = (formValues) => {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    const analytics = firebase.analytics();
    Object.entries(formValues).forEach(([fieldName, fieldValue]) => {
      analytics.logEvent("input_change", {
        field_name: fieldName,
        field_value: fieldValue,
      });
    });
  }
};
```

## Conclusion

The `firebaseClient` module is a crucial integration point for Firebase services within your application. It simplifies the process of setting up Firebase, managing data, and analyzing user behavior. The `trackInputChangeViaFirebase` function, in particular, provides valuable insights into how users interact with form fields, which can be instrumental in optimizing user experience and form design. Always ensure that user data is handled securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.
