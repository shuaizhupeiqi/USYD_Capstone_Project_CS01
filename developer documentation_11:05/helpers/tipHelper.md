# tipHelper



## Introduction

> The `tipHelper` module is a utility designed to assist in the presentation of tips and recommendations, along with associated imagery, to enhance user engagement and understanding. It provides a set of asynchronous functions that import data from JSON files, which include references to images that visually represent the advice given, such as a picture of a glass of water to suggest hydration.

## Functions

### loadAgeGroupTips

Imports age-specific tips from a JSON file, which may include image references to visually represent the advice for different age groups.

#### Returns

- A promise that resolves to an array of age group tips, each potentially containing an image reference, or `null` if an error occurs.

#### Example Usage

```
async function displayAgeGroupTipsWithImages() {
  const ageGroupTips = await loadAgeGroupTips();
  if (ageGroupTips) {
    ageGroupTips.forEach(tip => {
      console.log(tip.text);
      if (tip.image) {
        console.log(`Image URL: ${tip.image}`);
      }
    });
  } else {
    console.log("Failed to load age group tips.");
  }
}
```

### loadAllGeneralTips

Loads a comprehensive list of general tips from a JSON file, which may also include images to visually support the tips provided.

#### Returns

- A promise that resolves to an array of all general tips, each potentially accompanied by an image reference, or `null` if an error occurs.

#### Example Usage

```
async function displayAllGeneralTipsWithImages() {
  const allGeneralTips = await loadAllGeneralTips();
  if (allGeneralTips) {
    allGeneralTips.forEach(tip => {
      console.log(tip.text);
      if (tip.image) {
        console.log(`Image URL: ${tip.image}`);
      }
    });
  } else {
    console.log("Failed to load all general tips.");
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Each function within the `tipHelper` module includes error handling to catch and log any issues that occur during the import process. If an error is encountered, it is logged to the console, and the function returns `null` to signify that the data could not be loaded.

## Conclusion

The `tipHelper` module is an essential tool for applications that aim to provide actionable advice complemented by visual aids. By retrieving tips and associated images from JSON files, it allows developers to easily incorporate a rich and engaging user experience. The module's design ensures that tips are not only informative but also visually appealing, making it easier for users to understand and follow the recommendations.
