# Index



## Introduction

> This document provides an overview of the index HTML file for a web application. The index page serves as the entry point for the application and includes various meta tags, links to stylesheets, scripts, and other resources necessary for the proper rendering and functionality of the web application.

## Structure Overview

The index page is structured with standard HTML5 document structure, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. It is designed to be responsive and includes meta tags for viewport settings.

### Meta Tags

- **Charset**: Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document (`utf-8`).
- **Viewport**: Controls the page's dimensions and scaling for different devices.
- **Theme Color**: Sets the color of the toolbar (`#000000`).
- **Description**: Provides a brief description of the app for search engines.
- **Apple Mobile Web App Capable**: Indicates that the app can be added to the home screen on Apple devices.
- **Apple Mobile Web App Status Bar Style**: Sets the style of the status bar for the web app on Apple devices.
- **Apple Mobile Web App Title**: Specifies the title of the web app when added to the home screen on Apple devices.

### Icons and Favicon

Links to various icon sizes for different devices and favicon for browser tabs are included.

### Stylesheets

The page includes links to preloaded fonts and stylesheets necessary for the application's look and feel.

### Scripts

The page loads various scripts required for the application, including:

- **Google Tag Manager**: For tracking and analytics.
- **Next.js Scripts**: For the functionality of the Next.js framework.
- **Polyfills**: To ensure compatibility with older browsers.
- **Application Scripts**: For the specific logic of the web application.

### Skeleton Screens

The body of the document includes skeleton screens, which are placeholders that improve perceived performance by users. These are shown while the actual content is being loaded.

### Footer

The footer section contains copyright information and an image of the University of Sydney logo.

## Usage Example

To use this index page, developers should replace the placeholders with their actual content and scripts. For instance, the Google Tag Manager ID `G-KBENT73KP7` should be replaced with the actual tracking ID for the application.

## Conclusion

The index page is a crucial part of the web application, setting up the initial environment and loading all necessary resources. It is designed to be responsive and accessible, with provisions for analytics and performance optimizations. Developers should ensure that all links and scripts are updated to match their application's requirements before deployment.
