# hssHelper



## Introduction

> The `hssHelper` module is a comprehensive tool for processing geographical coordinates and returning a series of parameters for graphical representation. It is primarily used for the transformation of setting values and the retrieval of API data. The module employs the `phs` function to convert raw data into usable parameters, sorting them to identify the maximum and minimum risk levels. The processed data is then made available in the current state for use by other components in the application.

## Core Functionalities

### findTheMaxRiskValue

**Purpose:** Identifies the maximum risk value from a provided dataset and categorizes the risk level based on this value.

**Returns:** An object containing the maximum risk value, risk level, associated CSS class name, and time.

**Usage Example:**

```
const riskData = [
  { time: '10:00', riskValue: 0.8 },
  { time: '11:00', riskValue: 0.6 },
  // ... additional data
];

const maxRisk = findTheMaxRiskValue(riskData);
console.log(maxRisk);
// Output: { maxRiskValue: 0.8, maxRiskLevel: 'Extreme', style: { ... }, time: '10:00' }
```

### getData

**Purpose:** Loads personal settings from local storage and returns a weight divider.

**Returns:** The value of the weight divider.

**Usage Example:**

```
const settings = { w: [1.2, 0.8, 1.5] };
const divider = getData(settings);
console.log(divider);
// Output: The product of w values multiplied by 0.85
```

### getWDivider

**Purpose:** Retrieves a weight divider based on the user's personal settings from Firebase or local storage. This function checks if the user is logged in and their email is verified.

**Returns:** The value of the weight divider.

**Usage Example:**

```
getWDivider().then(wDivider => {
  console.log(wDivider);
});
```

### getHSSData

**Purpose:** Retrieves forecast data from the Open-Meteo API based on the provided geographical location and current time, including parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. It calculates risk scores using the `phs` method and processes the risk values to find the maximum risk for each day and handles the current risk value specially.

**Returns:** An object containing data for public display, current risk value, risk data for each day, maximum risk forecast, and more.

**Usage Example:**

```
const geoData = { latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060 };
const currentHour = new Date().getHours();
const translation = { current: "Current", maxLabel: "Maximum", currentMax: "Current/Maximum" };

getHSSData(geoData, currentHour, translation).then(data => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

## Conclusion

The primary goal of this module is to evaluate and process data related to meteorological risks. It fetches weather data from external APIs, calculates risk scores using this data, takes into account user personal settings, and generates visual representations based on risk values. The `hssHelper` module is the core part of the data processing and serves as a bridge between data retrieval and graphical output.
