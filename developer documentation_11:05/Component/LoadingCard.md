# LoadingCard



## Introduction

> The `LoadingCard` component is a modular React functional component that serves as a visual indicator of loading status within a Next.js application. It is designed to be reusable across different parts of the application, providing a consistent loading experience. The component utilizes the `Card` component from the Ant Design library to display a loading state.

## Implementation Details

### Imports and Dependencies

- `React`: Imported from the React library to create the component.
- `withRouter`: Imported from the `next/router` library, it provides the component with routing capabilities.
- `Card`: A component from the `antd` library, used to render a card with a loading state.
- `atom`, `useRecoilState`: Imported from `recoil` for state management within the component.

```
import React from "react";
import { atom, useRecoilState } from "recoil";
import { withRouter } from "next/router";
import { Card } from "antd";
```

### Component State

- `loading`: A boolean state that is always `true`, indicating that the card is in a loading state.

```
const loadingState = atom({
  key: "uniqueLoadingStateKey",
  default: true,
});
```

### Rendering

The `LoadingCard` component renders an `antd` `Card` with a `loading` property. When `loading` is `true`, the card displays a loading state, typically a spinner or loading indicator. The `style` property sets the card's width and top margin.

```
function LoadingCard() {
  const [loading] = useRecoilState(loadingState);

  return (
    <Card
      style={{
        width: "100%",
        marginTop: 16,
      }}
      loading={loading}
    ></Card>
  );
}
```

### Modular File Structure

The `LoadingCard` component is isolated in its own file for the following reasons:

- **Modularity and Reusability**: Separating such components into their own files allows for easy reuse throughout the application without duplicating code.
- **Simplicity and Clarity**: Breaking down components into smaller, more specific parts makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- In the context of the provided code snippet, the `LoadingCard` is used as a loading indicator, for instance, while chart data is being fetched, providing users with immediate feedback that content is on the way.

## Conclusion

The `LoadingCard` component is a straightforward representation of a loading state in card form. By isolating it in a separate file, developers can effortlessly reuse it across multiple areas of a project without the need to copy and paste code. This promotes cleaner code practices and eases maintenance and updates.
