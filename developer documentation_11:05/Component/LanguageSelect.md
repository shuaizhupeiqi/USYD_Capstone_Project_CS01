# LanguageSelect



## Introduction

> The `LanguageSelect` component is a React component used exclusively within the `SettingPage`. It leverages Recoil for state management to handle the application's language settings, providing users with a dropdown to select their preferred language.

## Importing Libraries and Components

- `React` and `useEffect`: From the React library, used for creating the component and managing its lifecycle.
- `withRouter`: From `next/router`, provides routing capabilities to the component.
- `Select`: A component from the `antd` library, used to render a dropdown box.
- `atom`, `useRecoilState`, `useRecoilValue`, `selector`, `useSetRecoilState`: Functions from the Recoil library for state management.
- `LanguageHelper`: A custom helper function that likely offers functionalities related to language, such as loading supported languages and changing the current language.

## Component State

- `loadingState`: A boolean value indicating whether the component is in the process of loading supported languages.
- `supportedLanguagesState`: An array storing the list of supported languages.
- `defaultLanguageState`: A string representing the default selected language, initially set to 'English'.

## Component Lifecycle

- The `useEffect` hook is used to asynchronously load the supported language list upon component mounting.

## Core Functionality

- `loadSupportedLanguage`: An asynchronous function that uses `languageHelper` (obtained from props) to load supported languages and update the component's state.
- `onChange`: A function called when the value of the dropdown changes, using `languageHelper` to change the current language of the application.
- `mainView`: Renders the language selection dropdown. It first constructs an array where each element is an object containing key, label, and value. Then, it uses the `Select` component from `antd` to display these options.

## Rendering

- If `loading` is true, a blank `div` is rendered, indicating that loading is in progress.
- Otherwise, the `mainView` method is called to render the language selection dropdown.

## Wrapping Up

- The `LanguageSelect` component is wrapped with `withRouter` and `LanguageHelper`, meaning the component has access to properties and methods related to routing and language.

## Conclusion

In summary, the `LanguageSelect` component allows users to select a language on the page. When a new language is selected, it uses `LanguageHelper` to change the current language of the application. It utilizes libraries such as `next/router` and `antd` to provide routing capabilities and a polished dropdown interface.
