# ChartForPublicDisplay

## Introduction

> The `ChartForPublicDisplay` component is a specialized React component for visualizing risk levels over time through a line chart. It is currently utilized within the `HssRiskDisplay.js` file as a part of a conditional rendering path that is not commonly activated. This component is designed for potential use in a public display context or as a testing page for the homepage UI and functionality.

## Component Context

### Usage in HssRiskDisplay.js

The component is referenced in `HssRiskDisplay.js` but is part of a conditional rendering logic that defaults to another view (`mainView`). The `ChartForPublicDisplay` is rendered when a certain condition (`isPublicDisplay`) is met, which is not the usual case. To see the functionality of `ChartForPublicDisplay`, one can modify the `render` method in `HssRiskDisplay.js`:

```
render() {
  return this.state.isPublicDisplay
    ? this.publicDisplayMainView()
    : this.mainView();
}
```

Under normal circumstances, `mainView` is loaded. However, by altering the code, one can switch to the `publicDisplayMainView`, which incorporates the `ChartForPublicDisplay`.

## Summary

The `ChartForPublicDisplay` page can serve as a test page for the homepage UI and features. It is a part of a test data file (`HssRiskDisplay.js`) and is not meant to be triggered under normal application use. If activated, it would display an alternative view that seems to be set up for testing purposes.

## Conclusion

While the `ChartForPublicDisplay` component is not part of the primary user interface, it remains a valuable tool for developers to test and visualize changes in the UI and functionality related to risk data visualization. Its conditional rendering within `HssRiskDisplay.js` allows for a flexible development and testing environment.
