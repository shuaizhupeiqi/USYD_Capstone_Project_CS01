# Chart 



# Introduction

> The `Chart` component is a specialized visualization tool used exclusively within the `HssRiskDisplay.js` file for the homepage to display current and future risk predictions. It is capable of rendering both line and area charts, although currently, only the line chart functionality is utilized.

## Specific Use

The component is used to draw line charts that depict risk levels over time. It is a key part of the "Today's Forecast" section on the homepage, providing users with a visual representation of current and future risk assessments.

## Components and Functions

### 1. **areaChart (Not Used in Current Project)**

The `areaChart` method is defined but not currently used in the project. It is designed to render an Area Chart, which could be used for visualizing data in a different format.

```
areaChart() {
  // ... (code for rendering the Area Chart)
}
```

### 2. **lineChart (Currently Used)**

The `lineChart` method is actively used to render a Line Chart. This method sets up the chart's margins, axes, reference areas for different risk levels, and the line that represents the risk value over time.

```
lineChart() {
  // ... (code for rendering the Line Chart)
}
```

## Usage and Code Examples

The `Chart` component is instantiated within the `HssRiskDisplay.js` file and is responsible for rendering the risk level visualization on the homepage. Here's a simplified example of how the `Chart` component is used:

```
import React from 'react';
import Chart from './Chart';

function HomePage() {
  // Data and state setup for the Chart component
  const riskData = {
    // ... (data that represents risk levels over time)
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Today's Risk Forecast</h1>
      <Chart
        data={riskData}
        // ... (other props and configurations)
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

## Additional Features

- **Customization**: The chart allows for customization of the fill colors for different risk levels, enhancing the visual differentiation between them.
- **Reactivity**: The chart updates dynamically in response to data changes, providing real-time risk level visualization.

## Conclusion

The `Chart` component is an integral part of the homepage, providing a visual representation of current and future risk levels. While it is currently set up to render only a Line Chart, the component has the capability to render an Area Chart if needed in the future. The use of reference areas and customized colors for different risk levels makes the chart a powerful tool for risk assessment and forecasting in the application.
